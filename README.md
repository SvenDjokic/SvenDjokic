## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Here is the latest project Iâ€™ve worked on:

[Berlin Services City Agent](https://github.com/SvenDjokic/final-project-berlin-city-agent)
Agentic AI chatbot that scrapes official Berlin city data and provides dynamic, real-time answers to users â€” leveraging Pinecone for vector storage and large language models for summarization.
